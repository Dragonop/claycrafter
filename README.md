# claycrafter
Minetest clay crafter mod. 
Adds a way for players to obtain clay other than mining, out of a common material: dirt. It adds three new nodes:

Claycrafter: Used to convert compressed dirt into clay.

Compressed dirt: Just 9 dirt, compressed, useful for saving storage space, too! (Not present if moreblocks is installed, use moreblocks:dirt_compressed instead)

Glass of water: Used as fuel for the Claycrafter. Placeable.
